# User Story: Marketplace Platform

## Overview
We want to build a modern, scalable marketplace platform similar to Mercado Libre. The platform will allow users to:
- Register and manage their profiles.
- List products for sale with images, descriptions, and pricing.
- Browse and search for products across categories.
- Add items to a shopping cart and complete purchases via integrated payment gateways.
- Rate and review sellers and products.
- Receive notifications about order status and promotions.

## Goals
- **Scalability**: Handle a large number of concurrent users and listings.
- **Performance**: Fast page loads and responsive UI.
- **Security**: Secure authentication, data protection, and safe transactions.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features such as messaging, promotions, or analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `docs` directory exists at the project root.
- This markdown file (`01_user_story.md`) is present and outlines the high‑level requirements.
- The content is clear, concise, and ready for further elaboration in subsequent documentation.
